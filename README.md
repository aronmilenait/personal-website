# üë©‚Äçüíª About this project
This is my personal and portfolio website. When I started developing it, I already had a portfolio. However, I wanted to dive into a new project, with important differences from the other one.

## ‚≠ê Features:
- **English and Spanish locales**, since I'm from Argentina and I use both languages for working.
- **Resume page**, which allows visitors to see my experience, tech skills, and education details -and I can send it just using that link!
- **About page**, where I briefly tell visitors a little bit about myself as a developer.
- **Projects page**, where I showcase my favorite ones and include a repository and/or deploy link, so visitors can check out my personal projects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- next-intl

### üí≠ Inspiration
After seeing [this](https://luzojeda.com/) personal website from another developer, I immediately loved the idea of mixing personal things (like pictures and thoughts) with work-related stuff (like my resume and projects).

For now, I just have the about, resume, and projects page, but I'm looking forward to incorporating the following ones:

- **Pictures Page**: a small gallery where I can share photos I've taken (especially from my cat!)
- **Articles Page**: a space where I can share stuff I write about software development.
- **Music Page** (maybe): a section where I can recommend songs that I love.

I believe that we can find a lot of inspiration from our peers. This means valuing and admiring their work and taking ideas to innovate instead of attempting to do the same. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
