# 🌹 Personal Website
Initially, it was meant to be a personal and portfolio website. As time passed by, it turned more into the second one.

## ⭐ Features:

- **English and Spanish locales**, since I'm from Argentina and I use both languages for working.
- **Resume page**, which allows visitors to see my experience, tech skills, and education details -and I can send it just using that link!
- **About page**, where I briefly tell visitors a little bit about myself, including a section where I share my likes as a developer.
- **Projects page**, where I showcase my favorite ones and include a repository and/or deploy link, so visitors can check out my personal projects.
- **Currently page**, a place for sharing what I'm doing at the moment with my career. It's constantly being updated!

## ⚙️ Technologies Used:

- Next.js
- TypeScript

### 💭 Inspiration

After seeing [this](https://luzojeda.com/) personal website from another developer, I immediately loved the idea of mixing personal things (like pictures and thoughts) with work-related stuff (like my resume and projects).

I believe that we can find a lot of inspiration from our peers. This means valuing and admiring their work and taking ideas to innovate instead of attempting to do the same.
