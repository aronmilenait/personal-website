# Portfolio
This website started by being a combination of a personal and a portfolio website. However, I started to feel more comfortable with the idea of it being merely for work and career-related purposes. 

## ⭐ Features:

- **English and Spanish locales**, since I'm from Argentina and I use both languages for working.
- **Resume page**, which allows visitors to see my experience, tech skills, and education details -and I can send it just using that link!
- **About page**, where I briefly tell visitors a little bit about myself, including a section where I share my likes as a developer.
- **Projects page**, where I showcase my favorite ones and include a repository and/or deploy link, so visitors can check out my personal projects.
- **Currently page**, a place for sharing what I'm doing at the moment with my career. It's constantly being updated!

## ⚙️ Technologies Used:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- next-intl

### 💭 Inspiration

I've taken many ideas from this website from [Lucas Ezequiel's](https://lojeda.co/es/) personal website. My favourite sections are "Likes", "Resume" and "Now", which I incorporated in my portfolio in similar ways.

I believe that we can find a lot of inspiration from our peers. This means valuing and admiring their work and taking ideas to innovate instead of attempting to do the same.
